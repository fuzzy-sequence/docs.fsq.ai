Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an essential component for businesses 
seeking to remain competitive in today's market.
The majority of AI products are designed with a cloud-centric approach.
However, these products may not be readily accessible to certain critical industries.
There are several scenarios where cloud-centric AI products are not suitable:

- unstable internet connection (e.g. remote areas)
- costs of data transfer (e.g. video streaming to the cloud)
- privacy concerns and regulations (e.g. GDPR)
- latency (e.g. real-time applications)

In these scenarios compute needs to run on the edge of the network:
on the devices, such as cameras, sensors, robots, drones or on the gateways that connect them.

## Why Fuzzy Sequence?

Fuzzy Sequence offers a platform for deploying and managing AI capabilities strongly focused on the edge devices.
The goal of this platform is to help the business to build and run AI-powered devices at scale.
The platform is designed to be used by data scientists, hardware manufacturers, integrators and solution providers.

1. The platform detaches the control plane from the data plane to ensure privacy.
   It only helps to manage the AI capabilities leaving developers in **full control of the data** and their devices' behavior.
2. The platform minimizes the need to **change the firmware** of the devices.
   This decreases the risks of bricking the device while providing up-to-date AI capabilities.
3. The platform manages the complexity of the deployments.
   It allows to **bundle model sets** and deploy them to groups of devices.
4. The platform is designed for uses cases with **unstable connectivity and field conditions**.
   The deployments are expected to run for many days and weeks.
5. Security is at the core of the platform.
   The platform support **model signing and traffic encryption**.

## For Data Scientists and MLOps

Fuzzy Sequence helps the data scientists and researchers
to monetize and expand the reach of their AI models
by deploying them to fleets of edge devices. Learn more about [Model Registry](/model-registry).

The platform makes it easy to incorporate Edge AI devices into the MLOps processes.
The Edge fleet becomes a part of their IaaS solution and unifying the practices across the organization.

## For Hardware Manufacturers

Fuzzy Sequence simplifies the process of building AI-powered devices. 

This helps businesses to improve performance of their existing products through deployment of ready-to use edge-optimized AI models.

## For Integrators and Solution Providers

Connection [Model Registry](/model-registry),
[Fleet Management Agent](/device-fleet-management) and [Console](/console) allows to radically simplify deployment and management
of AI-powered capabilities at scale.
It fills in the gap between RnD and production, driving implementation costs down.
